# Minimal Darker
Minimal Darker is the second of two icon packs I made for IOS several years ago during my brief attempt at teaching myself graphic design. This repository simply contains a zip file with all of the original, full resolution icons, as well as the .deb file needed to install this pack on a jailbroken iPhone. Minimal Darker, as the name suggests, is a clone of Minimal dark with one simple change. Instead of the dark grey backgrounds I used in Minimal Dark, Minimal Darker uses black backgrounds behind the white images themselves.
